APPLICATIONS OF C++ PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE TO DETERMINE SOIL PHASE RELATIONSHIP

This project delves into soil's diverse phases—solid, liquid (water), and gas (air)—defining their interrelationship. Using coded formulae, it accurately computes these soil phase connections, ensuring precise and efficient analysis.

The soil mass is characterised by a three pahse system which consists of solid particles, liquid and gas. For practical purposes, the liquid may be considered to be 
water and the gas as air. The inter relationships of the Different phases are important since they help to define the condition or the physical make-up of the soil.
Thus, employing the use of C++ in the computations in a an efficient and short span as the formulae are pre-defined in the software. The design of the software 
involved the use of the C++ programming lanuage to perform computations in a short time with higher accuracy. After inputing the required parameters needed to compute 
the various parameters, the software uses an algorithm to perform computations and generate the verified and accurate answers within a short time. 
Thus, this software program is quite efficent for calculating and establishing the soil phase relationship. 


The soil includes all earth materials, organic and inorganic, occuring in the zone overlying the rock crust. 

This system deals manifests the functionality of computing the soil phase relationship. To eradicate the complexities, errors and difficulties, the proposed system is
developed. Calculating the soil phase relationship on paper introduces inaccuracies. The values may be inaccurate due to human error. Thus, the use of this software reduces
or eliminates potential human error intruduced during calculations. This increases credibility and confidence in the values obtained. To reduce the faults "LunarGeo Soil Phase Software"
has been developed. This seeks to highlight on how this technology has the potential od reducing the manual work load and generating accurate results from the pre-defined formulae.


The computations are accurate and less time-consuming.
The data is modified per the requirement.
It does not involve recording data on paper.
Accuracy and efficiency are maintained.
